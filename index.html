          <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">WE HAVE 3 TYPES OF FOUNDATION STAGE-FLEXI FS1, FS1 AND FS2.</h5>
          <p class="text-muted"><b>Flexi FS1 Classes</b>
            The aim of the Flex-FS1 programme is to make the children's journey into a formal educational environment easy, fun-filled and stress-free for parents. Every child progresses at a different rate and there should be no rush or anxiety for the parents to acclimatise their child into the school experience. The Flexi-FS1 stream is conceptualised to provide parents with exactly this flexibility while also providing them the option of switching to the mainstream when they feel their child is ready. 
            
            This is a parallel stream of FS1 that will have significantly more flexibility for the parents/children who need it. The flexi-FS1 will essentially give parents the flexibility to:
            
            Continue using the current 5-day a week FS1 option, as before, with no changes to timings.
            Choose a 3 day or 4 day option instead of a 5 day option in the first two terms (note that all children will need to attend 5 days in the final term as they prepare for FS2).
            Enjoy a longer drop-off period to suit those who want an early drop-off or a later drop-off.
          <br>
          <br>
            <b>FS1 Classes:</b>
            The standard FS1 classes will continue to run and parents opting for the standard 5 days can continue to do so.
            
            All adequate measures will be taken to create a limited segregation between the standard FS1 classes and the Flexi-FS1 classes so that the elements of flexibility do not add to any disturbances to the standard classes, while ensuring that the children in the Flexi-FS1 classes are physically segregated to an extent but are still very much a part of the overall school.
          <br>
          <br>
            <b>FS2 Classes:</b>
    The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Framework sets out the standards for development, learning and care of children from birth  to five. It is important that all children are given the opportunity to  experience the best possible start to their education.  
    
    The Foundation Stage Curriculum is planned and resourced to take children's learning forward and to provide opportunities for all  children to succeed in an atmosphere of care and of feeling valued.

            <p class="text-muted"><b>PRIMARY OVERVIEW</b>
              At SCS we follow the National Curriculum of England, and the primary school is broken into two key stages: Key Stage 1 (Year 1 and 2) and Key Stage 2 (Year 3 – 6). Our creative, child led curriculum is designed around overarching concepts, which provide students with real life context that integrates and connects all curriculum areas. As a school, we ensure that we offer a consistent and seamless progression as the children transition across the different phases throughout the primary school.

            <p class="text-muted"><b>SECONDARY OVERVIEW</b><br>
              <b>Key Stage 3 (Years 7-9)</b>
      The curriculum ensures that the skills and the knowledge required for success at A Level and life beyond school begins in KS3.
      
      At SCS we ensure that the curriculum and reporting system is focused on the key skills and knowledge that students are developing, rather than giving a numerical level at KS3.
      
      There are 5 flightpaths, which will be used to explain progress:
      
      Launching Learner
      Emerging Learner
      Developing Learner
      Excelling Learner
      Mastering Learner
      <br><br>
      <b>Key Stage 4 (Years 10-11)</b>
      Our aim at Safa Community School (SCS) is to provide each and every one of our students with a broad and balanced KS4 curriculum that is tailored to the individual’s needs containing a range of possibilities and opportunities for their education Post-16. The Key Stage 4 courses and the way they are taught at SCS are designed to best prepare your child for their future. We hope therefore that you and your child will find our Key Stage 4 courses meet your needs and ambitions for the future. 
      
      GCSE Curriculum
      
      GCSE is the acronym for the General Certificate of Secondary Education. They are undertaken over the two years of Key Stage 4, i.e. Years 10 and 11 At SCS we offer GCSEs, IGCSEs and BTECs. The GCSEs consist of a 2 year programme of study in Years 10 and 11 (in Key Stage 4).
      <br><br>
      <b>Sixth Form</b> - The Crucial Decision
      The choices you make, about what and where to study in the Sixth Form, will have a significant bearing on your future life and career. The qualifications you acquire, the personal qualities and life skills that you develop and the friendships you forge will all be crucialal in determining how you cope with the transition from school to adult life, and your success in an increasingly competitive world.
      
      Why SCS Sixth Form?
      It is said that virtually all students find their time in the Sixth Form to be the most exciting and enjoyable of their whole school careers. It is not just an extension of life lower down the school; you will be studying the subjects that you have chosen. At Safa Community School we offer personalised learning pathways, with a range of different subjects and teaching styles to suit your learning needs and future plans. 
      
      Teaching groups will be smaller, allowing you to contribute more personally, and you will develop a more adult and informal relationship with staff.
      You will gain more independent study time, giving you the opportunity to explore your subjects in greater detail beyond the classroom.
      You will make new friends, often based on a shared interest in a particular area of study.
      You will have your own Sixth Form Common Room, and additional privileges not bestowed to younger year groups.
      You will be able to choose from a range of extra- curricular activities and integrate this into your curriculum time through the REACH programme.
      You will be guided through your future plans with a bespoke Sixth Form personal development programme, career guidance and University visits.
      You will be an integral part of the school community, helping with the running of the school and providing role models for the younger students.
      <br>
      Life in the Sixth Form:
      The secret to success in the Sixth Form is undoubtedly time management! You have to develop the self-discipline to work on your own and to juggle the demands of academic work and all the other opportunities too; this is an essential prerequisite to surviving not just the Sixth Form but university and also the world of work.
      
      Sixth Formers play a key role in many aspects of school life. The Sixth Form student body will provide the Senior School with student leadership roles, e.g. President, Vice President with a Cabinet of Senior Prefects.
      
      The Sixth Form will reflect an outstanding record of academic success, built on the high calibre of you the students and the excellence of our teaching, supported by first class facilities, small teaching groups and a well-developed system of support and guidance. For the vast majority of students all this combines to provide the very best environment in which to fulfil your potential and secure the best possible A-Level grades which are of course the passport to university places and rewarding future careers.
      <br><br>
